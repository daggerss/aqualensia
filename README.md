## Abstract
While marine biodiversity is crucial to sustaining a healthy and balanced planet through a wide range of species and ecosystems, it continues to encounter damaging anthropogenic activities like pollution and exploitation. These pressing issues are exacerbated by a general lack of knowledge and awareness among the public. Therefore, this project aims to develop a video game that raises awareness on underwater marine biodiversity by educating players on a multitude of marine species and the threats they face. The game hopes to assist in promoting marine conservation as a creature collector wherein the player captures photos of sea animals and learns about them in order to correctly identify their species for display at a gallery while occasionally encountering issues that prevent them from properly taking photos, like pollution and poaching.

## Game Overview
Aqualensia is a 2D creature collection game that educates players about underwater marine animals and the threats they experience. On a vibrant island as an underwater photographer, the player must dive in different locations to snap photos of various sea creatures where each photograph reveals more information about the animal. They must correctly identify its species by matching this information in relation to a gallery exhibit’s plaque information, allowing the player to learn more about each creature. However, the player will also be met with challenges such as pollution and illegal wildlife trade that prevents them from taking proper photos. Filling up the gallery raises the citizens’ awareness of the island’s biodiversity and the threats to it, in turn earning donations that will enable the player to unlock more locations and fund conservation efforts. Through the display of marine animals and the challenges they face, Aqualensia aims to raise awareness and promote empathy towards these creatures, hopefully inspiring players to become advocates for the protection of marine biodiversity.
