  _galleryInfo: Oil spills occur when petroleum is released into the environment,
    harming marine life, habitats, and livelihoods. The oil coats the feathers and
    fur of birds and mammals, leading to suffocation and reduced insulation. It also
    contaminates the water, affecting fish and shellfish populations and disrupting
    the food chain. The impacts can persist for years, highlighting the need for
    sustainable energy alternatives.
