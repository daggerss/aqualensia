  _photoInfo:
  - It's picking at something green on the seafloor.
  - They're a bit of lone wolves unless they're feeding.
  - It gets quite protective of its turf.
  - It seems to be attacking with something sharp on the sides of its tail.
  _galleryInfo: The Powder Blue Tang primarily feeds on benthic algae, grazing on
    it as a staple part of its diet. Though typically solitary, they are sometimes
    seen in large feeding groups. Despite their communal habits, they're known for
    their aggressive territorial behavior, particularly towards their own kind. These
    fish possess a distinctive scalpel-like spine, characteristic of surgeonfish,
    which they may use for defense or asserting dominance.
