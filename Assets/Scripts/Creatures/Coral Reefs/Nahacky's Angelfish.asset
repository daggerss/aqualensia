  _photoInfo:
  - Born female, it can change to male when necessary.
  - A male usually has a group of females to mate with.
  - Caught one nibbling on corals. This naughty fish!
  - Said to be found only at the Johnson Atoll- well, until now!
  _galleryInfo: Endemic to the Johnson Atoll, the Nahacky's Angelfish employs a unique
    reproductive strategy as a protogynous hermaphrodite. Beginning life as females,
    some individuals undergo a transition to males within their social structures,
    necessary for maintaining a harem. In these social groups, a dominant male oversees
    and mates with a group of females. They may exhibit aggressive tendencies, occasionally
    nipping at corals.
