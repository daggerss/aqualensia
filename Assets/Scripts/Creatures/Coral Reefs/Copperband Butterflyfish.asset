  _photoInfo:
  - That snout is perfect for reaching into small crevices!
  - What was that in its mouth? Looks like a worm.
  - It frequently swims together with another- perhaps a partner?
  - Their false eye has likely fooled some enemies.
  _galleryInfo: The Copperband Butterflyfish showcases a diverse diet, preying primarily
    on worms, clams, and mollusks with the help of its elongated beak. During breeding,
    these fish exhibit monogamous behavior, forming pairs for reproduction. It is
    easily distinguished by its striking yellow banding and a false eye spot near
    its tail, in which the latter serves as a clever defense mechanism to confuse
    and deter potential predators.
