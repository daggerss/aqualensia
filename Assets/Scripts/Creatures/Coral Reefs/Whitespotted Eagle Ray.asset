  _photoInfo:
  - Careful! That tail is venomous.
  - Often digging their snouts in sand flats to find food.
  - I was able to film one of them giving birth to live young!
  - Seen leaping out of the water on occasion.
  _galleryInfo: "In a process known as ovoviparity, the Whitespotted Eagle Ray produces
    eggs that hatch inside the mother's body before giving birth to live young. It
    forages for mollusks and other prey in the sand, using its electroreceptors to
    locate buried prey. Equipped with venomous tail spines, it can defend itself
    against threats. They breach the water\u2019s surface to escape predators, give
    birth, or shake off parasites."
